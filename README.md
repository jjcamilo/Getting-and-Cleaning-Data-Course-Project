# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

##Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

##Objectives of the Project

You should create one R script called *run_analysis.R* that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Additional Information

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the *CodeBook.md* file.
